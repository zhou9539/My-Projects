# Risk Control Model for Trading System

### Project Overview:

$\bullet$ Use GARCH model to describe the volatility of return

$\bullet$ Derive the conditional cumulative distribution function of five assets

$\bullet$ Construct five dimensional Archimedean copula by distribution function

$\bullet$ Based on copula, use Monte Carlo Simulation method to simulate the returns and calculate ES

$\bullet$ Use a structured multi factor risk model to forecast returns

$\bullet$ Allocate weights based on optimization model (ES as restriction)

$\bullet$ Determine the number of shares according to the weight and do one hour trading
