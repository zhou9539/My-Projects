# Risk Control Model for Trading System

# Project Overview:
∙  Use GARCH model to describe the volatility of return

∙  Derive the conditional cumulative distribution function of five assets

∙  Construct five dimensional Archimedean copula by distribution function

∙  Based on copula, use Monte Carlo Simulation method to simulate the returns and calculate ES

∙  Use a structured multi factor risk model to forecast returns

∙  Allocate weights based on optimization model (ES as restriction)

∙  Determine the number of shares according to the weight and do one hour trading
